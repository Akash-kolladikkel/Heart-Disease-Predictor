# Heart Disease Prediction


## Overview
This project aims to predict the presence or absence of heart disease using logistic regression. The model is trained on a dataset obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, and the performance metrics indicate its effectiveness in predicting heart disease.This project provides an interactive and user-friendly interface powered by Streamlit, allowing users to explore the predictions by adjusting the input parameters.

## Dataset
The Heart Disease dataset, available on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease), is a comprehensive collection of health-related attributes with a primary focus on heart disease detection. This dataset originally comprises 76 attributes, but research efforts have commonly utilized a subset of 14 key features. Notably, analyses have predominantly centered around the Cleveland database, which stands as the primary resource in the machine learning community.

## Key Features
- Logistic regression model for heart disease prediction.
- Web app interface for interactive predictions.



## Workflow
- **Data Collection:** The Heart Disease dataset is fetched from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, containing 76 attributes related to heart health.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Exploring the dataset to understand its structure and visualizing the distribution of the target variable (heart disease presence).
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling duplicate and null values, imputing missing values, and preparing the data for model training.
- **Model Building:** Utilizing logistic regression to train a model capable of distinguishing between the presence and absence of heart disease.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessing the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- **Web Application Deployment:** Creating a user-friendly web application using Streamlit for interactive heart disease predictions.

## Performance Metrics
- **Accuracy:** 86.9%
- **Precision:** 90.0%
- **Recall:** 84.4%
- **F1 Score:** 87.1%
